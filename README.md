Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/pakkorn

pakkorn was a 2007 attempt to create a apt/rpm/yum like tool for Windows.
That tool was never finished.
The sources were move in 2015 from google code to github to not lose what was already done, 
but don't expect that project to be usuable one day.
