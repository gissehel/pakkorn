pakkorn is a package manager that download/install/upgrade various packages from internet. pakkorn aims to provide on windows what linux distributions provide threw their builtins package manager (apt/pdkg, rpm, etc.).

While sharing some concepts with linux package managers, pakkorn doesn't follow the exact same principles, and so doesn't share code.
